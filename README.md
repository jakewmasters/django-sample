# django-sample
A basic Django app.

## Prerequisites
I developed this application on a Windows machine, so some of the commands will vary depending on your OS.  

## Setup
First, I would advise using PyCharm for an IDE as it makes Django development fairly simple.  

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Create and activate a virtualenv.  
3. In the terminal, run `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
4. You're ready to go!  

## Components
*This section under major construction*  
This sample Django application demonstrates several key features of Django:  
- ORM  
- Django templating language  
- views.py  
- models.py
